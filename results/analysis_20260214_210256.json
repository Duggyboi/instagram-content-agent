  "transcription": "If you watch these three videos, you'll know more about RAAG than 99% of people. First, RAAG and LLM fine-tuning. This video explains what RAAG actually is and when you should use it over another technique. It includes a quiz to make sure you actually understand the concepts and it's taught by a former data scientist at Google and staff machine learning engineer at GitHub. Next, watch building enterprise RAAG solutions. This teaches you how real companies actually build large-scale RAAG systems. It's incredibly useful both for AI engineering interviews and for building personal projects that you want to actually scale. Tought by a former Google research scientist. Third, retrieval evaluation. A lot of people can build a simple RAAG system, but not many people can build an excellent one and that's because they don't know how to evaluate the results. This is still a new and developing skill set and I guarantee you'll stand out if you know this. Follow on comment RAAG and I'll send the links to all three lectures.",
